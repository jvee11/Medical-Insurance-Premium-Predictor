# Insurance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting insurance-related costs or outcomes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate insurance expenses based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and other relevant features.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Performance evaluation
- Deployment

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project typically contains information such as:
- **Age**: Age of the insured individual
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Smoking Status**: Whether the person is a smoker
- **Number of Dependents**: Family size
- **Medical History**: Health conditions affecting insurance costs
- **Region**: Geographic location of the individual
- **Charges**: Insurance cost (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine learning models)
- Flask / Streamlit (For deployment - optional)

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-prediction.git
cd insurance-prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to train the model:

```sh
python train.py
```

To make predictions using a trained model:

```sh
python predict.py --input data/sample_input.json
```

## Model Training
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Apply feature scaling and encoding.
4. Train models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
5. Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, R-squared.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved the following results:
- **R-squared Score**: 0.85
- **Mean Squared Error**: 1200

## Deployment
The model can be deployed using Flask or Streamlit:

```sh
python app.py
```
